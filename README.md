Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

For Android: Press the R key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M (on Window and Linux) or Cmd âŒ˜ + M (on macOS)) to see your changes!

For iOS: Hit Cmd âŒ˜ + R in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸ¥³
